 PROBLEM STATEMENT
 
 There is a lot of news coverage and social media discussion on the situation in Ukraine. 
 A client has asked you to work with a proof of concept to build a solution to collect 
 and analyze sentiment related to Ukraine from different sources in 1 platform. Eventually, 
 they would like to use this platform to analyze data for other topics beyond Ukraine, 
 but feel that 1 case (Ukraine) and 1 data source will make a good scope for the POC. 
 Write code for collection and processing for the first source so that it can be presented 
 in an upcoming meeting with the client.
